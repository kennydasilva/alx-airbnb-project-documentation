Airbnb Clone Backend — Features and Functionalities
 Overview

This document lists the key backend features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.
It serves as the foundation for the system design, diagrams, and API specifications that will be developed in later phases of the project.

The backend will provide a RESTful API that supports user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, payments, and notifications — just like the core logic behind Airbnb.

Core Functionalities
1. User Management

User Registration:
Users can sign up as guests or hosts.
Secure authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Login & Authentication:
Login via email and password.
Optional OAuth integrations (Google, Facebook).

Profile Management:
Update profile photo, personal details, and preferences.

2. Property Listings Management

Add Listings:
Hosts can create new listings by providing title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.

Edit/Delete Listings:
Hosts can modify or remove their own properties.

Image Upload:
Support for property images using local file storage or external services (AWS S3 / Cloudinary).

3. Search and Filtering

Search properties by:

Location

Price range

Number of guests

Amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly, etc.)

Implement pagination for large datasets.

4. Booking Management

Create Booking:
Guests can reserve properties for specific dates.
The system validates date conflicts to prevent double bookings.

Cancel Booking:
Hosts or guests can cancel bookings based on policy.

Booking Status:
Track booking states: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.

5. Payment Integration

Secure payments via Stripe or PayPal API.

Support multiple currencies.

Automatic payouts to hosts after booking completion.

Store payment receipts and transaction logs.

6. Reviews and Ratings

Guests can review properties after completed bookings.

Hosts can respond to reviews.

Prevent abuse by linking each review to a valid booking.

7. Notifications System

Send email and in-app notifications for:

Booking confirmations

Payment updates

Cancellations

Use services like SendGrid or Mailgun.

8. Admin Dashboard

Admins can manage and monitor:

Users (guests, hosts)

Listings

Bookings

Payments

Reviews

Provide reporting and system metrics.

 Technical Requirements
Category	Description
Database	Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. Required tables: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews.
API Development	RESTful endpoints following CRUD principles (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Use proper HTTP status codes. Optionally support GraphQL.
Authentication & Authorization	Secure user sessions with JWT. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for guests, hosts, and admins.
File Storage	Store images locally or integrate cloud storage (AWS S3 / Cloudinary).
Third-Party Integrations	Use Stripe or PayPal for payments, SendGrid for emails.
Error Handling & Logging	Implement global error handling middleware and log important events.
 Non-Functional Requirements
Requirement	Description
Scalability	Use modular architecture to support load balancing and horizontal scaling.
Security	Encrypt sensitive data; implement rate limiting, validation, and firewall configurations.
Performance	Use caching (Redis) and optimize queries for faster responses.
Testing	Implement unit and integration tests using Jest, Mocha, or Pytest equivalents.
Maintainability	Code should follow SOLID principles and be well-documented.

Summary

The Airbnb Clone Backend will implement a robust and secure RESTful API supporting:

User registration, authentication, and profiles

Property listing and management

Search, booking, and payment workflows

Review and notification systems

Administrative controls and reporting

This blueprint provides the foundation for all future design and implementation tasks, ensuring a scalable, secure, and efficient backend system.
