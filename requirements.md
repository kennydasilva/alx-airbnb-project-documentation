 Backend Requirement Specifications — Airbnb Clone
 Overview

This document details the technical and functional requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend system.
It focuses on three core backend features:

User Authentication

Property Management

Booking System

Each section outlines the API endpoints, input/output data, validation rules, and performance considerations.

 User Authentication
 Objective

Enable users (guests and hosts) to securely register, log in, and manage their sessions using JWT-based authentication.

 Functional Requirements

Allow new users to register with unique email addresses.

Authenticate users with email and password.

Issue a JWT token upon successful login.

Allow users to update their profiles.

Secure all endpoints using middleware authentication.

 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Authentication
POST	/api/auth/register	Register a new user	
POST	/api/auth/login	Log in and get JWT token	
GET	/api/users/profile	Get current user profile	
PUT	/api/users/profile	Update user profile	
 Input / Output Specifications
 Register User (POST /api/auth/register)

Request Body:

{
  "name": "Kenny DaSilva",
  "email": "kenny@example.com",
  "password": "Passw0rd!",
  "role": "host"
}


Response:

{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "token": "<jwt_token>"
}


Validation Rules:

name: required, 3–50 characters

email: required, unique, valid format

password: required, min 8 chars, must include letters and numbers

role: must be either "guest" or "host"

 Performance & Security

Passwords encrypted using bcrypt before storage.

Token expires after 24 hours.

Use rate limiting on /login to prevent brute-force attacks.

 Property Management
 Objective

Allow hosts to create, update, and delete property listings while enabling guests to view and search available properties.

 Functional Requirements

Hosts can create new property listings with details (title, description, location, price, and amenities).

Guests can search and view listings.

Only the property owner can update or delete their listings.

Enable image upload (stored locally or via cloud).

 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Authentication
POST	/api/properties	Create a new property listing	 (Host only)
GET	/api/properties	Get all property listings	
GET	/api/properties/:id	Get property details by ID	
PUT	/api/properties/:id	Update property details	 (Host only)
DELETE	/api/properties/:id	Delete a property listing	 (Host only)
 Input / Output Specifications
 Create Property (POST /api/properties)

Request Body:

{
  "title": "Cozy Apartment in Maputo",
  "description": "A beautiful modern apartment near the city center.",
  "location": "Maputo",
  "price_per_night": 75,
  "amenities": ["WiFi", "Air conditioning", "Pool"]
}


Response:

{
  "message": "Property created successfully",
  "property_id": 12
}


Validation Rules:

title: required, max 100 chars

description: required

price_per_night: positive number

location: required

amenities: array of strings (optional)

 Performance & Security

Index properties by location for fast search queries.

Validate ownership before allowing updates/deletions.

Support pagination and filtering for listing retrieval.

 Booking System
 Objective

Allow guests to book available properties and manage their bookings while ensuring accurate date validation and availability.

 Functional Requirements

Guests can create bookings for available dates.

Prevent overlapping bookings for the same property.

Hosts and guests can cancel bookings.

Track booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled, completed).

 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Authentication
POST	/api/bookings	Create a new booking	 (Guest)
GET	/api/bookings/:id	Get booking details	
GET	/api/bookings/user/:id	Get all bookings by user	
PUT	/api/bookings/:id/cancel	Cancel a booking	
GET	/api/bookings/property/:id	View bookings for a property	 (Host only)
 Input / Output Specifications
 Create Booking (POST /api/bookings)

Request Body:

{
  "property_id": 12,
  "check_in": "2025-11-10",
  "check_out": "2025-11-15",
  "guests": 2
}


Response:

{
  "message": "Booking created successfully",
  "booking_id": 45,
  "status": "pending"
}


Validation Rules:

property_id: must exist in database

check_in and check_out: valid ISO dates

check_out > check_in

No overlapping bookings allowed for the same property

 Performance & Security

Use database-level unique constraints to avoid double booking.

Use transactions to maintain data consistency during booking and payment.

Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed property data.

 Summary
Feature	Core Endpoints	Security	Key Focus
User Authentication	/api/auth/*	JWT + bcrypt	Secure login & sessions
Property Management	/api/properties/*	Role-based (Host)	CRUD + Filters
Booking System	/api/bookings/*	JWT + Date validation	Prevent overlaps
 Additional Notes

All endpoints return standardized JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes:

200 → Success

201 → Created

400 → Bad Request

401 → Unauthorized

404 → Not Found

500 → Server Error

The API follows REST conventions and is easily extensible for future features (Payments, Reviews, Notifications).
